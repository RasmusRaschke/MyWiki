This is my personal encyclopedia for everything I have learned so far in my studies. Obviously, it is not nearly finished! If you find any mistakes or have questions, feel free to ask me.

This is an obsidian vault, so if you want to use this little wiki to its full extend, you have to download obsidian. However, it is completely free!

Many thanks to Zhaoshen Zhai, who programmed the scripts and built the general structure of the vault.
