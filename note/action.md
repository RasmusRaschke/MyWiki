``` ad-Definition
title: Definition (Smooth Action).
Let $M$ be a [[manifolds|smooth manifold]] and $G$ be a [[group]]. A __smooth action__ of $G$ on $M$ is a [[homomorphism|group homomorphism]] $$G \to \text{Diff}(G)$$ $$g \mapsto \phi_g: M \to M$$ with $\phi_{g_1} \circ \phi_{g_2} = \phi_{g_1g_2}$ and $\phi_{g^{-1}} = (\phi_g)^{-1}$.

```
**Examples.**
1.  The Group $\Z$ acts directly on $\R$ by means of translation: For $k \in \Z$ the action is given by $\phi_k: \R \to \R$, $t \mapsto \phi_k(t) = t+k$.
2.  The Group $\text{SO}(2)$ acts on $\R^2$ while leaving the unit circle $\S^1 \in \R^2$ invariant. Let $A \in \text{SO}(2)$ with $A \neq \id$ and let $G_A \sub \text{SO}(2)$ be the subgroup generated by $A$. There are two cases:
	1. $A$ is a rotation around an angle $2\pi \cdot \frac{p}{q}$ with $\text{ggT}(p,q) = 1$. Then $G_A$ is a cyclic subgroup of order $q$.
	2. $A$ is a rotation around an irrational multiple of $\pi$. Then $k \to A^k$ is injective and every orbital is [[dense]] in $\S^1$.
