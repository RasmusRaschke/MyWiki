title: Definition (Basis of a Topology).

Let $X$ be a set. A <ins>basis</ins> for a [[topological space|topology]] $\cT$ on $X$ is a collection $\cB$ of subsets of $X$ such that
1. $\forall x \in X \exists B \in \cB: x \in B$.
2. If $x$ lies in the intersection of $B_1, B_2 \in \cB$ there exists $B_3 \in \cB$ such that $x \in B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2$.

A topology $\cT_\cB$ generated by $\cB$ is defined by calling $U \sub X$ open if for each $x \in U$ there is a $B \in \cB$ such that $x \in B \sub U$.
```
*Proof.*
We have to show that this actually defines a topology $\cT$ on $X$:
1. The empty set fulfils the condition vacuously. The whole set $X$ is also open since there is a basis element $B \ni x$ with $B \sub X$ .
2. Let $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ be a family of open sets with $U:= \cup_{i \in I} U_i$. For every $x \in U$ we find some index $i \in I$ with $x \in U_i$ and a basis element $x \in B \sub U_i$ because $U_i$ is open. This implies $B \sub U$ and therefore $U \in \cT_\cB$.
3. Let $U_1, U_2 \in \cT_\cB$. For $x \in U_1 \cap U_2$ we choose basis sets $x \in B_i \sub U_i$. Since $x \in B_1 \cap B_2$ we find $B_3$ with $x \in B_3 \sub B_1 \cap B_2 \sub U_1 \cap U_2$. Therefore, the intersection is also open. This can be extended to countable intersections by induction.
