``` ad-Definition
title: Definition (connected).

A [[topological space]] $X$ is called __connected__ if it can not be separated into two open, disjunct, non-empty subsets.
So for any two open, non-empty subsets $U, V \sub X$ with $X = U \cup V$ the identity $U \cap V \neq \emptyset$ holds.

```
``` ad-Definition
title: Definition (path-connected).

A [[topological space]] $X$ is called __path-connected__ if for any two points $x,y \in X$ one can find a continous mapping $$c: [0,1] \to X$$ with $c(0) =x$ and $c(1) = y$.
