``` ad-Theorem
title: Theorem (Constant Rank Theorem).
Let $M$ and $N$ be [[manifold|smooth manifolds]] and $F: M \to N$ be a [[smooth mapping]] with constant rank $r$, $\dim N = n$ and $\dim M = m$. For each $p \in M$ there exists [[chart|smooth charts]] $(U, \phi)$ for $M$ centered at $p$ and $(V, \psi)$ for $N$ centered at $F(p)$ such that $F(U) \sub V$. In these [[chart|charts]] $F$ has the coordinate representation $$\hat{F} (x_1, \dots, x_r, x_{r+1}, \dots, x_m) = (x_1, \dots, x_r, 0, \dots, 0).$$
If $F$ is a [[submersion, immersion and embedding|smooth submersion]], the representation is given by $$\hat{F} (x_1, \dots, x_{n}, x_{n+1}, \dots, x_m) = (x_1, \dots, x_n, 0, \dots, 0).$$
If $F$ is a [[submersion, immersion and embedding|smooth immersion]], the representation is given by
$$\hat{F} (x_1, \dots, x_m) = (x_1, \dots, x_m, 0, \dots, 0).$$
