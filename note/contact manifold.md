``` ad-Definition
title: Definition (Contact Manifold).

A __contact manifold__ is a [[manifold]] $M$ with $\dim M = 2d+1$ and a maximally non-integrable hypersurface field $\xi^{2d} \sub TM$.

```

**Remark.**
For hypersurface fields $\Delta^{n-1} \sub TM$ with $\Delta = \ker \alpha$ is the [[frobenius theorem|integrability condition]] given by $\alpha \wedge d\alpha =0$. If $M$ has dimension $2d+1$ there exist [[smooth k-form|$1$-forms]] with $\alpha \wedge (d \alpha)^{\wedge d} \neq 0$ everywhere at least locally. These volume forms are called maximally non-integrable.

**Example.**
On $\R^{2d+1}$ with coordinates $(x_1, \dots, x_d, y_1, \dots, y_d, z)$ the condition is satisfied by $$\xi = \ker \left( \alpha = dz + \sum_{i=1}^d y_i dx_i \right).$$
