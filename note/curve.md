``` ad-Definition
title: Definition (Curve).

A __$\cC^k$-curve__ is a map $$\gamma: I \to M$$ of class $\cC^k$ with $I \sub \R$.
If $\gamma$ is of class $\cC^\infty$ and $M$ is a [[manifold#Smooth Manifolds|smooth manifold]], it is called __smooth curve__.
If $M=\R^n$, $\gamma = (\gamma_1, \dots, \gamma_n)$ is called __curve in $\R^n$__ and is given by component functions $$\gamma_k: I \to \R$$ with $k \in \{1, \dots, n\}$.
