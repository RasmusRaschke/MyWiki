``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition (Embeddings are Injective Immersions).
Let $M$ and $N$ be [[manifold|smooth manifolds]] and $M$ be [[compact]]. Let $F: M \to N$ be an [[submersion, immersion and embedding|injective immersion]]. Then $F$ is an [[submersion, immersion and embedding|embedding]].
Moreover, if $\dim M = \dim N$ and $N$ is [[connectedness|connected]], $F$ is a [[diffeomorphism]].
