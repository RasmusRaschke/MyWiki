# Homology

``` ad-Definition
title: Definition (Homology).

Let $C_\ast$ be a [[chain complex]]. The abelian group $$H_n(C):=Z_n(C)/B_n(C)$$ is called <ins>$n$-th homology group</ins> of $C_\ast$. The equivalence classes of $c \in Z_n(C)$ are called <ins>homology classes</ins> and denoted $[c] = c + B_n(C)$.
If $c,c'\in C_n$ satisfy $c-c' \in B_n(C)$ we call them <ins>homologous</ins> to each other.
```

We want to check that being homologous defines an [[relation#Equivalence Relation|equivalence relation]]:
 1. Since $c-c=0$ and $d_{n+1}$ is a homomorphism, the relation is reflexive.
 2. If $c$ is homologous to $c'$, we have $c-c'=d_{n+1}y$ and therefore $c'-c=-d_{n+1}y$. This makes the relation symmetric.
 3. Let $c,c',c'' \in C$ with $c-c'=d_{n+1}y$ and $c'-c'' = d_{n+1}z$. Then, $c-c'+c'-c'' = d_{n+1}y+d_{n+1}z = c-c''$. Hence, it is also transitive.

**Examples.**
 1. We consider $$C_n=\begin{cases} \Z \, &\text{if}\, n\in \{0,1\}\\ 0 \, &\text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$ and let $d_1$ be multiplication with $n \in \N$. The kernel of $d_0: \Z \to \{0\}$ is always $\Z$. The image of $d_1$ is $n\Z$. All other homology groups have trivial numerator and are therefore trivial: $$H_n(C)=\begin{cases} \Z /n\Z \, &\text{if}\, n=0\\ \{0\} \, &\text{otherwise.} \end{cases}$$
 2. Now, set $C_n=\Z$ for all $n$ and $$d_n=\begin{cases} \id_\Z \, &\text{if}\, n \, \text{is odd}\\ 0 \, &\text{otherwise.} \end{cases}$$ For even $n$, the kernel of $d_n$ is the whole group $\Z$. The image of $d_{n+1}$ is in this case also the whole group and we obtain trivial homology. If $n$ is odd, the kernel of $d_n$ consists only of $0$,  This is also true for the image of $d_{n+1}$ and we again obtain trivial homology: $$H_n(C) = \{0\}.$$
 3. Reconsider example 2. with $d_n = 0$ for all $n \in \Z$. The image is now $\{0\}$ and the kernel the whole group $\Z$. We obtain non-trivial homology $$H_n(C) = \Z.$$

# Singular Homology

``` ad-Definition
title: Definition (Singular Homology).

Let $X \neq \emptyset$ be a [[topological space]] and $S_\ast(X)$ be the [[singular simplex#Singular Chain Modules|singular chain complex]] of $X$. The <ins>n-th singular homology group</ins> of $X$ is given by
$$H_n(S_\ast(X)) := Z_n(S_\ast(X))/B_n(S_\ast(X)).$$
We often write $H_n(X)$, $Z_n(X)$ and $B_n(X)$ for short.
```

**Examples.**
1. $Z_0(X) = S_0(X)$ since everything is mapped to $0$.
2. Consider the [[chain complex#Chain Complexes|$1$-chain]] $c:=\alpha + \beta + \gamma$ with $\alpha, \beta, \gamma: \Delta^1 \to X$ such that $\alpha(e_1)=\beta(e_0)$, $\beta(e_1) = \gamma(e_0)$ and $\gamma(e_1) = \alpha(e_0)$. We obtain:
$$
\partial(c) = \partial(\alpha + \beta + \gamma) = \partial_0(\alpha + \beta + \gamma) - \partial_1(\alpha + \beta + \gamma) = (\alpha + \beta + \gamma) (d_0^0 - d_1^0).
$$
Plugging in $e_0=(1)$ yields
$$
\begin{align}
\partial c(e_0) &= (\alpha + \beta + \gamma) (d_0^0(e_0) - d_1^0(e_0))=(\alpha + \beta + \gamma) ((0,1)-(1,0))  \\
&= \alpha(e_1)-\beta(e_0)+\beta(e_1)-\gamma(e_0)+\gamma(e_1)-\alpha(e_0)=0.
\end{align}
$$
Hence, $c$ is an [[chain complex|$n$-cycle]].

**Example.**
Consider the one-point space $\{\ast\}$. Its homology is given by
$$
H_n(\ast) \cong \begin{cases} 0, &\text{if } n>0,\\ \Z, &\text{if } n=0.\end{cases}
$$
For every $n \geq 0$ there is only one continuous map $\alpha: \Delta^n \to \{\ast\}$, the constant map $\kappa_n$. We calculate the boundary:
$$
\partial \kappa_n = \sum_{i=0}^n \kappa_n d_i = \sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i \kappa_{n-1} = \begin{cases} \kappa_{n-1}, &n \text{ even},\\ 0, &n \text{ odd}.\end{cases}.
$$
The [[singular simplex#Singular Chain Modules|chain modules]] are given by $S_n(\ast) \cong \Z$ for all $n$, generated by $\kappa_n$. The [[singular simplex#Singular Chain Modules|singular chain complex]] is of the form
```tikz
\usepackage{tikz-cd}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzcd}[scale=3]
\cdots \arrow[r, "0"] & Z \arrow[r, "id_Z"] & Z \arrow[r, "0"] & Z.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{document}
```

# Reduced Homology

Let $P=\{\ast\}$ be the one-point [[topological space]] which is [[category#Terminal Objects|final]] in $\Top$. Therefore, we always have one continuous map 
$$
\epsilon: X \to P
$$
for all $X \in \Obj(\Top)$. This map induces a map on homology by
$$
H_n(\epsilon): H_n(X) \to H_n(P)
$$

``` ad-Definition
title: Definition (Reduced Homology).
The <ins>reduced $n$-th homology group</ins> of a [[topological space]] $X$ is given by
$$
\tilde{H}_n(X):=\ker(H_n(\epsilon)).
$$

```

**Remarks.**
1. For $n\geq 1$, we have just $\tilde{H}_n(X) \cong H_n(X).$
2. For path-connected $X$, reduced homology is trivial: $\tilde{H}_0(X)=\{0\}$. This follows from the [[zeroth homology group|augmentation isomorphism]] $\epsilon: H_0(X) \cong \Z$ for path-connected $X$.
3. The selection of any base point $x \in X$ gives an [[isomorphism]] $\tilde{H}_n(X) \oplus H_n (\{x\}) \cong H_n(X)$ because $H_n(P)\cong H_n(\{x\})$ and the composition $\{x\} \hookrightarrow X \to \{x\}$ is the identity. The [[retract|retraction]] $r: X \to \{x\}$ splits the [[long exact sequence|exact sequence]] $$\cdots \to H_n(\{x\}) \to H_n(X) \to H_n(X, \{x\})\to \cdots,$$ proving $\tilde{H}_n(X) \cong H_n(X, \{x\})$.
4. Prolonging a [[singular simplex#Singular Chain Modules|singular chain complex]] $S_\ast(X)$ yields a chain complex $\tilde{S}_\ast(X):$ $$\cdots \to S_1(X) \to S_0(X) \overset{\epsilon}\to \Z \to \{0\}$$ with the [[zeroth homology group|augmentation map]] $\epsilon(\alpha)=1$ for all $\alpha: \Delta^0 \to X$, so we obtain $$\tilde{H}_\ast(X) \cong H_\ast(\tilde{S}_\ast(X)).$$

## Functorial Property

``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition (Functor of Reduced Chains).
The assignment $X \mapsto H_\ast(\tilde{S}_\ast(X))$ is a [[functor]], as well as $\tilde{H}_\ast(\cdot).$
```
*Proof.*
Any continuous $f: X \to Y$ induces a [[chain complex#Chain Map|chain map]]
$$
S_\ast(f): S_\ast(X) \to S_\ast(Y).
$$
Considering the change in $S_0(f)$ for reduced chain modules, we obtain $\epsilon^Y S_0(f)=\epsilon^X,$ so $\epsilon$ is indeed a boundary operator. This means that the induced map
$$
H_\ast(\tilde{S}_\ast(f)): H_\ast(\tilde{S}_\ast(X)) \to H_\ast(\tilde{S}_\ast (Y))
$$
preserves the identity and is associative under composition, as desired.

# Relative Homology

``` ad-Definition
title: Definition (Relative Homology).

Let $S_\ast(X,A)$ be the [[relative chain complex|relative chain complex]] of the pair of spaces $(X,A)$. The <ins>relative homology groups</ins> of (X,A) are given by
$$
H_n(X,A) :=H_n(S_\ast(X,A)).
$$
```

## Reduced Relative Homology

``` ad-Definition
title: Definition (Reduced Relative Homology).
Let $X$ be a [[topological space|topological space]] and $A \sub X$ be a non-empty subspace. We define the <ins>reduced relative homology group</ins> with respect to $A$ by
$$
\tilde{H}_n(X,A):=H_n(X,A).
$$

```

# Cellular Homology

``` ad-Definition
title: Definition (Cellular Chain Complex).
The <ins>cellular chain complex</ins> $C_\ast(X)$ of a [[CW complex]] $X$ is defined as 
$$
C_n(X):=H_n(X^n, X^{n-1})
$$
with boundary operator
$$
d: H_n(X^n, X^{n-1}) \overset{\delta}\to H_{n-1}(X^{n-1}) \overset{\rho}\to H_{n-1}(X^{n-1},X^{n-2})
$$
with $\rho$ being the map induced by the projection $S_{n-1}(X^{n-1}) \to S_{n-1}(X^{n-1}, X^{n-2})$ and $\delta$ is the [[connecting homomorphism]].
```
We need to make sure $d$ is a boundary operator. Note that $d^2 = \rho \delta \rho \delta$, but $\rho \delta$ is a composition in the [[homology long sequence]], guaranteeing $d^2=0$.
We see that $C_n(X)$ is a free abelian group with 
$$
C_n(X) \cong \bigoplus_{\sigma} \tilde{H}_n(\S^n) \cong \bigoplus_{\sigma} \Z
$$
by our considerations [[singular homology of CW complexes|here]]. For $n<0$, $C_n(X)$ is trivial as expected. 

**Remark.**
If $X$ has only finitely many $n$-cells, the $n$-th chain complex $C_n(X)$ is finitely generated. If $X$ is a finite CW complex, then $C_\ast(X)$ is finitely generated as chain complex: $C_n(X)$ is only non-trivial for finitely many $n$, and for each such degree $C_n(X)$ is finitely generated. In this case, the boundary operator can be calculated as integer matrix $\Mat_\Z (n \times n)$.
