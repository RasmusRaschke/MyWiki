``` ad-Definition
title: Definition (Homomorphism).

Let $(X, \ast)$ and $(Y, \diamond)$ be two sets together with a binary operation. A __homomorphism__ between $X$ and $Y$ is a map $\phi: X \to Y$ which satisfies the property $$\phi(x \ast y) = \phi(x) \diamond \phi(y)$$ for all $x, y \in X$.
```

**Examples.**
1.  If $X$ and $Y$ are [[group|groups]] $\phi$ is called __group homomorphism__.
2.  [[linear map|Linear maps]] between two [[vector space]] $X$ and $Y$ are __vector space homomorphisms__.
