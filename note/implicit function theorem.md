title: Theorem (Implicit Function Theorem).

Let $U,V \sub \R^n$ be open subsets with $p \in U$. Let furthermore $F: U \to V$ be a smooth mapping. If $F_{\ast, p}$ is invertible at $p$ there exist [[connectedness|simply connected]] neighbourhoods $U_0 \sub U$ of $p$ and $V_0 \sub V$ of $F(p)$ such that $$F|_{U_0}: U_0 \to V_0$$ is a __diffeomorphism__.
