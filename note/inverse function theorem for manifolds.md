``` ad-Theorem
title: Theorem (Inverse Function Theorem for Manifolds).

Let $M, N$ be [[manifold|smooth manifolds]] and $F: M \to N$ be a [[smooth mapping]]. If $F_{\ast, p}$ is invertible at $p \in M$ there exist [[connectedness|connected]] neighbourhoods $U_0$ of $p$ and $V_0$ of $F(p)$ such that $$F|_{U_0}: U_0 \to V_0$$ is a [[diffeomorphism]].
