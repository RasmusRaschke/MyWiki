title: Theorem (Inverse Function Theorem).

Let $U \sub \R^n$ be an open subset and $$f: U \to \R^n$$ be a continously differentiable function. Let $a \in U$ be a point and $b := f(a)$. Assume that the Jacobian $\cD f(a)$ is invertible.
Then there exists an open neighbourhood $U_0 \sub U$ of $a$ and $V_0$ of $b$ such that $$f|_{U_0}: U_0 \to V_0$$ is bijective with a continously differentiable inverse $$g = f^{-1}: V_0 \to U_0.$$ Furthermore, $\cD g(b) = (\cD f(a))^{-1}$.
