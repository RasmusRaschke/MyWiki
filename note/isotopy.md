# Definition

# Of Symplectic Manifolds

``` ad-Definition
title: Definition (Symplectic Isotopy).
Let $(M, \omega)$ be a [[symplectic manifold]] without boundary. A <ins>symplectic isotopy</ins> is a smooth map
$$
\begin{align}
\Psi: [0,1] \times M &\to M\\
(t,q)&\mapsto \psi_t(q)
\end{align}
$$
such that $\psi_t$ is a [[symplectic manifold#Morphisms|symplectomorphism]] for every $t \in [0,1]$ and $\psi_0$ is the identity.
```
Symplectic isotopies are generated by a smooth family of [[vector field|vector fields]] $X_t:M \to TM$ via 
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \psi_t = X_t\circ \psi_t
$$
with $\psi_0 =\id$. The [[vector field|vector fields]] $X_t$ are [[vector field#Symplectic Vector Fields|symplectic]] since $\psi_t$ is a symplectomorphism. Therefore, $d(X_t \iprod \omega) = 0.$

## Hamiltonian Isotopies

``` ad-Definition
title: Definition (Hamiltonian Isotopy).
A symplectic isotopy
$$
\begin{align}
\eta : [0,1] \times M &\to M\\
(t,q)&\mapsto \psi_t(q)
\end{align}
$$
is called <ins>Hamiltonian</ins> if $X_t \iprod \omega$ is an exact $1$-form.
```
This means that $X_t$ is a [[hamiltonian function#Hamiltonian Functions, Vector Fields and Flows|Hamiltonian vector field]] for every $t$. One can always find a [[hamiltonian function|Hamiltonian]] 
$$
H: [0,1] \times M \to \R
$$
such that $H_t$ generates the field $X_t$ by $X_t \iprod \omega = dH_t$. In this case, $H$ is called <ins>time-dependent Hamiltonian</ins>. The isotopy $\eta$ determines $H$ up to an additive function $c: [0,1] \to \R$.

**Remark.**
If $M$ is simply connected then every symplectic isotopy is a Hamiltonian isotopy.
