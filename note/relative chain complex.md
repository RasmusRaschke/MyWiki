Consider the situation where we have a [[topological space|topological space]] $X$ with a subspace $A \sub X$ and the canonical inclusion $\iota: A \hookrightarrow X$. This induces a map $S_n(i):S_n(A) \to S_n(X)$ on [[singular simplex#Singular Chain Modules|singular chain complexes]] which generally fails to be a [[monomorphism]]. As an example of that, consider $\S^1 \hookrightarrow \D^2$.

# Relative Chain Complexes

``` ad-Definition
title: Definition (Relative Chain Complex).
Let $(X,A)$ be a pair of [[topological space|topological spaces]]. The <ins>relative chain complex</ins> of $(X,A)$ is defined b<
$$
S_\ast(X,A):=S_\ast(X)/S_\ast(A).
$$
Elements of $S_n(X,A)$ are called <ins>relative chains</ins>. <ins>Relative cycles</ins> in $S_n(X,A)$ are chains $x$ with $\partial^X(c)=0$ such that their generators have image in $A$. <ins>Relative boundaries</ins> are chains $c$ in $X$ with $x=\partial^X(b)+a$ where $a$ is a chain in $A$.
```

We denote continuous maps between pairs of spaces $(X,A)$ and $(Y,B)$ by $$f:(X,A) \to (Y,B)$$ if $f(A) \sub B$. In this case, a map $$S_\ast(f):S_\ast(X,A) \to S_\ast(Y,B)$$ is induced.

**Remarks.**
1. Instead of describing relative chain complexes as [[relation#Equivalence Relation|quotients]], we can equivalently define them as free abelian group generated by all [[singular simplex|$n$-simplex]] $\beta: \Delta^n \to X$ whose image is not completely contained in $A$.
2. The definition immediately implies $$S_n(X,\emptyset) \cong S_n(X),$$ $$S_n(X,X)=\{0\}$$ and $$S_n(X \sqcup X', X')\cong S_n(X).$$
