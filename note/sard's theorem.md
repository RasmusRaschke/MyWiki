``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition (Sard's Theorem).
Let $M$ and $N$ be [[manifold|smooth manifolds]] and $F: M \to N$ be a [[smooth mapping]]. The [[lebesgue measure]] of the set of [[regular and critital points|critical points]] of $F$ is $0$ in $N$. Therefore, the set of [[regular and critital points|regular values]] of $F$ is [[dense]].
