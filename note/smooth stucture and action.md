``` ad-Proposition
title: Preposition (Smooth Structure and Action).

Let $G$ be a finite group acting smoothly and [[free action|freely]] on a smooth [[manifolds|manifold]] $M$.
Then the [[equivalence|quotient space]] $M \diagup G$ has an unique smooth structure such that the projection $$\pi: M \to M \diagup G$$ is a [[local diffeomorphism]].
