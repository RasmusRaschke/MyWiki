``` ad-Definition
title: Definition (Symplectic Manifold).

A pair $(M, \omega)$ with a [[manifold|smooth manifold]] $M$ and a differential form $\omega$ is called __symplectic manifold__ if $\omega \in \Omega^2(M)$ with $d \omega = 0$ and if $\omega$ isn't degenerate. This means that for all points $p \in M$ the mapping $$T_p M \to T^\ast_p M$$ $$v \mapsto \omega(v, .)$$ is an [[isomorphism]].
