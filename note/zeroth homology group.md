``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition (The $\epsilon$-map).
Let $X$ be any [[topological space]]. There is a [[category|homomorphism]] $$\epsilon: H_0(X) \to \Z$$ with $\epsilon \neq 0$ for $X \neq \emptyset$.

```
*Proof.*
For $X \neq \emptyset$, we set $\epsilon (\alpha) = 1$ for any $\alpha: \Delta^0 \to X$. With this, we obtain
$$
\epsilon \left( \sum_{i \in I} \lambda_i \alpha_i \right) = \sum_{i \in I} \lambda_i
$$
on $S_0(X)$. This sum is indeed finite as only finitely many $\lambda_i$ are non-trivial. It remains to show that the map is well defined on homology, for which it has to vanish on boundaries. Intuitively, this is clear if we imagine $\epsilon$ to be a map on [[singular simplex|singular chains]] induced by the projection $\text{pr}: X \to \{\ast\}$.
To prove it more rigorously, we consider $c \in S_0(X)$ with $c = \partial b$ for some $b= \sum_{i\in I}\nu_i \beta_i$ with $\beta_i: \Delta^i \to X$. Direct calculation shows:
$$
\partial b = \partial \sum_{i \in I} \nu_i \beta_i = \sum_{i \in I} \nu_i (\beta_i d_0 - \beta_i d_1) = \sum_{i \in I} \nu_i \beta_i d_0 - \sum_{i \in I} \nu_i \beta_i d_1.
$$
The result is obtained by plugging in:
$$
\epsilon(c) = \epsilon (\partial b) = \sum_{i \in I} \nu_i - \sum_{i \in I} \nu_i = 0.
$$
We defined $S_0(\emptyset)$ to be $\{0\}$, therefore $H_0(\emptyset) = 0$ and we set $\epsilon = 0$.

``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition (Epsilon-Isomorphism).
Let $X \neq \emptyset$ be a path-connected [[topological space]]. In this case, $\epsilon$ is an [[isomorphism]] $$H_0(X) \cong \Z.$$

```
*Proof.*
Since $X$ is not empty, we find $x \in X$ and the constant map $\kappa_x$ in $S_0(X)$ with $\epsilon(\kappa)=1$. Therefore, $\epsilon$ is [[set-function#Injection, Surjection, Bijection|surjective]]. For any other point $y \in X$ we find a continuous path $\omega: [0,1] \to X$ with $\omega(0) =x$ and $\omega(1)=y$. Define $\alpha_\omega: \Delta^1 \to X$ as $$\alpha_\omega(t_0, t_1) = \omega(1- t_0).$$ We obtain
$$ \partial \alpha_\omega = \partial_0 \alpha_\omega - \partial_1 \alpha_\omega = \alpha_\omega (e_1) - \alpha_\omega (e_0) = \alpha_\omega (0,1) - \alpha_\omega (1,0) = \kappa_y - \kappa_x$$
and the two generators $\kappa_x$ and $\kappa_y$ are [[homology|homologous]]. This proves [[set-function#Injection, Surjection, Bijection|injectivity]].

``` ad-Proposition
title: Corollary (Induced Decomposition).
Let $X$ be of form $$X = \coprod_{i \in I} X_i$$ such that all $X_i$ are non-empty and path-connected. This induces a decomposition
$$
H_0(X) \cong \bigoplus_{i \in I} \Z.
$$

```
*Proof.*
The [[singular simplex#Singular Chain Modules|singular chain complex]] $S_n$ splits as direct sum $$S_n(X) \cong \bigoplus_{i \in I} S_n(X_i)$$ for all $n$. The [[singular simplex#Boundary Operator|boundary operators]] are fully contained in their components. In particular,
$$
\partial: S_1(X) \cong \bigoplus_{i \in I} S_1 (X_i) \to \bigoplus_{i \in I} S_0 (X_i) \cong S_0(X).
$$
is the direct sum of the boundary operators $\partial: S_1(X_i) \to S_0(X_i)$.

In this sense, the zeroth homology group is the free abelian group generated by path-components.
